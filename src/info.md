# Notice

I duplicated Hodl smart contract file and made all the functions public why? 
because i'm still a noob "just my second week of learning solidity" which i know is 
kinda crazy, but i won't let over complication slow my learning.

So as i'm saying `Hodl.sol` and `HodlTestFile.sol` have same functionality, the only
difference is the visibility of the functions `Hodl.sol` is the prod file and `HodlTestFile.sol`
i made all the functions public for testing purposes, but the functionality DID NOT CHANGE.
